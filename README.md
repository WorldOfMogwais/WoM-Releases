## Introduction
<p align="left"><img src="https://www.mogwaicoin.org/images/Gizmo-Happy.png"style="float: left;" width="80" height="80"/>
As one of the first games ever based on the blockchain technology, the player is immersed in the World of Mogwais and experiences many exciting adventures. We see the gamification of the blockchain technology as an exciting experiment, in which we want to introduce the functionality and advantages of the blockchain technology to a broad audience without specific knowledge in a playful and immersive way.

A project is only as good as its community, who drive the project forward with passion and joy and tell others about it. So if you have a good idea, which is valuable for the project, please write an [enhancement issue](https://github.com/orgs/WorldOfMogwais/projects/4) in github.
</p>
Thank you for believing in the vision and us and for being part of this exciting journey!

Warmest regards

[The World of Mogwais Team](https://github.com/WorldOfMogwais/WoM-Releases/wiki/01-Team)

## Story
The World of Mogwais game is based on Mogwai Coin, an experimental blockchain project, driven by the idea of adding gamification to the blockchain technology. Beeing forked of [Dash](https://www.dash.org/), an adaptive and cutting-edge cryptocurrency of the twenty-first century, we can offer solid features like masternode-technology, near-instant and secure payments, anonymous transaction and last but not least gamification elements for the community. Get further information regarding the blockchain technology and the Mogwai Coin cryptocurrency [here](https://github.com/WorldOfMogwais/WoM-Releases/wiki/06-Mogwai-Coin-Cryptocurrency).

In the game You interact with one or more Mogwais. It's concept is based on popular role playing games and will include some features as found in trading card games. The story about "The World of Mogwais" is based on a cultural background in Asia. However, the story and the interpretation we are following is not limited to this universe. It involves creative ideas and fictional realities without any relation to culture or religious backgrounds.

## Gameplay Alpha Version
The nature of the game is, that your Mogwai is an indivuel creature wich you cannot control directly in the game. But he's depending on your management skills to become better and better. Stronger and more experienced Mogwais can go on tougher adventures, defeat stronger opponents and, with a bit of luck, find special and rare items that makes him even better.

The current version of the adventure is of course isn't the experience we target for. It will be something to watch and be thrilled. The passages where he explores the dungeon will be skipable and combats should have a great visual attraction.
Dungeon statistics during the adventure and looting the mobs will enhance the adventure too.

So stay tuned, we publish new features in short intervals!

## Why is the game unique?
### Bot driven
The player interacts with the virtual character (Mogwai) by equipping him with items and sending him on exciting missions. From there, the AI expert system takes over and plays the game in the place of the player and imitating human behavior.

### On demand gaming
The player can either watch the adventures live or follow them later and see which battles were won and which (hopefully rare) items were found.

### Game watching
We are seeing a change in game consumption, many players no longer want to play themselves, they prefer to follow the games of their online heroes. Streaming platforms such as twitch.tv and eSports are now enjoying great success.

### Education
The game is designed to convey the Blockchain technology in a playful and immersive way.

### Burning coins
Actions in the game burns coins, this is the only way of interaction with The World of Mogwai. The concept of burning coins implements a unique deflationary factor. [More information](https://github.com/WorldOfMogwais/WoM-Releases/wiki/03-Burning-&-Interaction--Concept)

### Broad Audience
We are convinced that gamification will bring blockchain technology closer to a broad audience, especially to convince the Generation Z, they grew up with games and online worlds and are in our opinion very receptive to such an approach.

### Char management
One of the first games which stores the character information on the block chain.

### Infrastructure
The game does not require any additional server infrastructure, it is built on the individual nodes of the Mogwaicoin infrastructure.

### Transaction Explorer
In the future, World of Mogwais events can also be displayed via the Mogwaicoin explorer (browser where users track their transactions)

### Scalable
Our assumption is that the number of simultaneous players will not be a problem. The block size is the deciding factor here. As a fallback, an action in the game could be delayed by for example 4 minutes.

### Mining
One idea we want to pursue is that the player can activate a inbuilt miner functionality, which automatically mines MOG's during the game. The MOG's can then be used to buy items in the game.

### Analysis and transparency
The game makes use of the unchangeable and traceable system of the blockchain, where the adventures of the Mogwais can be followed by all players. For example the fights of the other players can be watched.

### Community driven
The game will be complemented in a later phase by the World of Mogwais website, which will provide a platform for the community. It is planned to offer functionalities like tracking the adventures of other players, statistics, stories and merchandising.

### Creativity
Features such as pattern recognition on the block hash which unlocks special events such as premade maps in the game and more.

## Get the latest release
The game is under constant development and is currently available in a playable alpha version. [Get the game for your plattform](https://github.com/WorldOfMogwais/WoM-Releases/releases/) and experience many exciting adventures with your Mogwais! Feedback is always welcome.
